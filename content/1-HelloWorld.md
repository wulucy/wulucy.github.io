Summary: Welcome to my blog!

I recently realized that many people interested in data science have blogs to record and share their work. Creating a blog has been on my to-do list for a few months now, but I lacked the time and energy to deal with web development until now (school is hard!). Fortunately, I've finally finished finals and took a day to figure out the Pelican package -- so here I am! Hello, World!

I'll be posting mainly about personal data science projects and data science/statistics concepts that I find interesting.

(A few technical details: this blog is powered by [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) and uses the [Flex theme](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/flex).)
